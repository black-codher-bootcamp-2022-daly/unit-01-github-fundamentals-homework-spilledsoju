# My Journey
## How has my experience learning about Git been?

I have learnt about the key fundamentals about git & github and their functions. For example, I know that the **touch** command is used to create a file and the **mkdir** is to make a new directory.

Something I still *struggle* with in github is <sub>open up new repositories in the terminal and committing my work onto github</sub>. I've had some previous issues with my setup that still needs to be worked on. Relating to this, asking for help is also tricky as I'm not familiar to how Git and Visual Studio Code, it's hard to exactly articulate to people ***how*** I am struggling with the software.
